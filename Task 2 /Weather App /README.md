# 🌤 Weather App

A simple and responsive **Weather App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that fetches real-time weather data using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  

This project helps you understand **API integration**, **asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)**, and **DOM manipulation** — all wrapped in a clean and minimal UI.
